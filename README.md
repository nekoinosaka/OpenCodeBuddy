## What ships

- A macOS bridge that pairs with the StickS3, syncs time, installs the native BLE helper, and manages the local `codex` shim.
- A StickS3 firmware build with status, approval, settings, and offline screens.
- A daily workflow designed to stay out of the way: run `code-buddy` once, then just use `codex`.

## Highlights in v0.1.45

- Both the packaged and locally rebuilt native BLE Helper now target macOS 13 explicitly, keeping release and repair builds launchable across every supported macOS version even when built on prerelease systems.
- Live quota updates now recover automatically when a stale Codex app-server credential is rejected, while the last valid allowance remains visible during recovery.
- A normal reboot no longer makes the USB-powered landscape clock wait for the Mac: plausible retained RTC time is reused offline, while the 2000-01-01 reset sentinel still requires a fresh trusted sync.
- `code-buddy doctor` now treats a loaded-but-crashing launchd agent as a real fault instead of reporting the setup ready.
- The quota meter now keeps the last valid allowance when a fresh account read is unavailable or BLE disconnects, and the Mac bridge restores that value after restarting instead of clearing the device.
- The Figma-based landscape dashboard shows `RUNNING`, `WAITING`, `IDLE`, or `OFFLINE`, plus a smooth 20-second trace of real input-plus-output token consumption. New samples enter from the right, scroll left, and rise from green toward mint as activity increases.
- Auto-oriented home surfaces resolve a strong pose before their first frame and remember the last stable home orientation across menus and settings, preventing the portrait-layout flash when returning to an already-landscape device.
- The portrait home screen keeps its original 90px-high, 1x ASCII pet while restoring the built-in 6x8 font used by its centering geometry; `HH:MM:SS` is one centered native-14pt row with dim seconds, and the date uses native 8pt.
- Native-size JetBrains Mono Regular/Bold labels and slashed-zero numerals keep the compact hierarchy crisp; zero counts remain dim white, seconds 60%-white, and date text full white.
- The full-width 29-by-3 quota matrix retains its 6 px dots and diagonal running wave, aligned to the new 4 px footer baseline and left edge.
- The landscape clock and dashboard use native-size JetBrains Mono Regular/Bold bitmap subsets with no fractional stretching; non-ASCII UI text stays on one proportional font, leaving ample application flash free.
- One short chime plays after a complete Codex turn. This includes managed CLI sessions and main Codex Desktop tasks discovered from local session logs; repeated snapshots and subagent turns are de-duplicated.
- Secure Wi-Fi OTA supports manual Mac-push updates and an optional automatic update mode, with signed manifests, physical confirmation, rollback checks, and compact on-device progress.
- The charging clock and active runtime share the landscape layout while keeping approval and settings interactions readable.

## Quick start

### 1. Flash the StickS3

Download `code-buddy-sticks3-v{version}-full.bin` from GitHub Releases and flash it at `0x0`.

Preferred path:

- If a release includes a web flasher, use it and write the merged image at `0x0`.

Fallback:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 code-buddy-sticks3-v0.1.45-full.bin
```

Developer release build:

```bash
./scripts/build-firmware-release.sh
```

The build produces two distinct artifacts: `*-full.bin` is the USB recovery/
bootstrap image, while `*-app.bin` is the application-only image accepted by
OTA. Never pass the merged full image to the OTA command.

### 2. Install on macOS

```bash
brew install CharlexH/tap/code-buddy
code-buddy
```

On first run, Code Buddy will:

- install the native Bluetooth helper
- pair with a `Codex-*` device
- sync device time
- install the launchd agent
- install the local `codex` shim
- add `~/.code-buddy/bin` to `~/.zprofile`

Host-only updates do not require reflashing when the installed firmware remains
protocol-compatible. Features that change the display, sound, or OTA runtime do
require the matching firmware release.

### Wireless firmware updates

After the OTA-capable bootstrap has been flashed once and Wi-Fi has been
provisioned from Settings, open **Settings > OTA update** on Code Buddy, then
run:

```bash
code-buddy firmware update
```

For a development build, select the app-only image explicitly:

```bash
code-buddy firmware update --firmware firmware/.pio/build/m5stack-sticks3/firmware.bin
```

The background agent remains the sole Bluetooth owner. It signs an immutable
one-time manifest using the already-pinned trust under `~/.code-buddy/ota`,
serves the image over short-lived local HTTPS, and waits for physical A-button
confirmation. Trust is never generated or rotated by this command. If trust is
missing, repeat the explicit USB trust bootstrap. B or Ctrl-C cancels before
the boot slot is committed; the Mac reports success only after reconnection
proves the embedded target version is running and first-boot health is valid.

Turn on **Settings > auto ota** to let the device accept a newer trusted release
without opening the manual confirmation screen. Automatic updates still use the
same signed manifest, version policy, boot-health validation, and rollback path.

The native BLE helper runs as a background macOS agent during normal use, so reconnect attempts should not open a helper window or steal focus. macOS may still show the first Bluetooth permission prompt; that system prompt cannot be skipped. For helper debugging, start it with `CODE_BUDDY_BLE_HELPER_DEBUG_WINDOW=1` to show the event log window.

### 3. Use it normally

```bash
codex
```

Open a new shell after setup. From there, Code Buddy keeps the bridge alive and shows approval prompts on the StickS3 while you keep your normal CLI flow.

Codex Desktop tasks are discovered read-only from local Codex session logs. They
can update the dashboard, unread count, and completion chime, but Desktop
approval requests are not proxied through the device.

Large local session-log scans run outside the bridge's async event loop, so they
cannot delay the 10-second BLE keepalive and accidentally trigger the device's
30-second offline state. If a core bridge task exits unexpectedly, the agent
exits cleanly and the existing launchd service restarts it.

## Controls

|                         | Normal               | Pet         | Info        | Approval    |
| ----------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **A** (front)           | next screen          | next screen | next screen | **approve** |
| **B** (right)           | scroll transcript    | next page   | next page   | **deny**    |
| **Hold A**              | menu                 | menu        | menu        | menu        |
| **Power** (left, short) | toggle screen off    |             |             |             |
| **Power** (left, ~6s)   | hard power off       |             |             |             |
| **Shake**               | dizzy                |             |             | —           |
| **Face-down**           | nap (energy refills) |             |             |             |

The screen auto-powers off after 30 seconds of inactivity and stays on while an approval prompt is pending. Any button press wakes it.

## Buddy states

| State       | Trigger                     | Feel                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `sleep`     | bridge not connected        | eyes closed, slow breathing |
| `idle`      | connected, nothing urgent   | blinking, looking around    |
| `busy`      | sessions actively running   | sweating, working           |
| `attention` | approval pending            | alert, **LED blinks**       |
| `celebrate` | level up (50K tokens), Friday clock | confetti, bouncing          |
| `dizzy`     | you shook the stick         | spiral eyes, wobbling       |
| `heart`     | approved in under 5s        | floating hearts             |

When the StickS3 is on USB power, its RTC retains valid time, and there is no running or waiting session, it can show the charging clock. The device only needs one successful time sync: after a normal reboot it can keep using retained RTC time while the Mac is temporarily offline. If RTC power is lost and the clock resets to 2000-01-01, it still waits for the next trusted sync. On Fridays from 15:00 until midnight, the pet occasionally celebrates: about 4 seconds in each 12-second cycle.

<details>
<summary><strong>Characters and custom packs</strong></summary>

The firmware ships with eighteen ASCII pets. Each one includes seven animations: `sleep`, `idle`, `busy`, `attention`, `celebrate`, `dizzy`, and `heart`.

Use `menu -> next pet` on the device to cycle through them. The selection is saved in device storage.

If you want a custom GIF character, create a pack with a `manifest.json` and 96px-wide GIFs for the same seven states:

```json
{
  "name": "bufo",
  "colors": {
    "body": "#6B8E23",
    "bg": "#000000",
    "text": "#FFFFFF",
    "textDim": "#808080",
    "ink": "#000000"
  },
  "states": {
    "sleep": "sleep.gif",
    "idle": ["idle_0.gif", "idle_1.gif", "idle_2.gif"],
    "busy": "busy.gif",
    "attention": "attention.gif",
    "celebrate": "celebrate.gif",
    "dizzy": "dizzy.gif",
    "heart": "heart.gif"
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `idle` can be a single GIF or an array of GIFs.
- Heights up to about 140px fit well on the StickS3 screen.
- See [firmware/characters/bufo/](firmware/characters/bufo/) for a working example.
- Use [firmware/tools/prep_character.py](firmware/tools/prep_character.py) and [firmware/tools/flash_character.py](firmware/tools/flash_character.py) to prepare and flash assets.
