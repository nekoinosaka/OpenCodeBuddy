# OpenCode Buddy Firmware

This firmware targets the M5Stack StickS3 and turns it into a OpenCode Buddy display
and approval device. Managed OpenCode CLI sessions support approvals, while OpenCode
Desktop contributes read-only task status and completion cues through the host.

> Building your own hardware client instead? See [REFERENCE.md](REFERENCE.md) for the BLE protocol and JSON payloads.

## User Flashing Path

1. Download `opencode-buddy-sticks3-v{version}-full.bin` from GitHub Releases.
2. Flash that merged image onto the StickS3 at address `0x0`.

Primary path:

- If this release publishes a web flasher page, use it.

Fallback path:

```bash
esptool --chip esp32s3 --port /dev/cu.usbmodem101 --baud 460800 write_flash 0x0 opencode-buddy-sticks3-v0.1.41-full.bin
```

After flashing, go back to the Mac and run:

```bash
opencode-buddy
```

That will request Bluetooth permission, pair the StickS3, sync time, and finish the Mac-side setup.

## Runtime display

When the device is landscape, the Figma-based face shows a four-state task
indicator, a smooth continuous trace of real input-plus-output token consumption over the most recent 20 seconds, quarter-minute time
progress, and `RUN`, `ASK`, and `NEW` task counts. The full-width bottom 29-by-3
meter uses 6 px dots with 2 px gaps, aligned to the 4 px footer baseline and
left edge, to show remaining
OpenCode allowance. While a task runs, its remaining dots animate with a diagonal
wave across RUN-green, blue, and lavender rows. A short chime plays once per
completed turn when **Settings > sound** is enabled.
When a fresh allowance read is temporarily unavailable, the last valid meter
remains visible across BLE disconnects instead of being cleared.

The landscape clock, date, and task dashboard use native-size ASCII subsets of
JetBrains Mono Regular and Medium without fractional bitmap scaling. Non-ASCII UI text uses the single proportional
`efontCN_12` face, and compact utility screens retain the built-in fallback
font. The subset can be regenerated with
`scripts/generate-jetbrains-mono-font.sh`; its SIL Open Font License 1.1 text is
stored in `licenses/JetBrainsMono-OFL.txt`.

The OTA-capable firmware can receive signed app-only updates from
`opencode-buddy firmware update`. **Settings > auto ota** enables automatic trusted
updates. Full recovery images remain USB-only and must be written at `0x0`.

## Developer Build Path

Build and flash directly with PlatformIO:

```bash
pio run -t upload
```

If you need a clean reflash:

```bash
pio run -t erase && pio run -t upload
```

Build the merged GitHub Release artifact:

```bash
../scripts/build-firmware-release.sh
```

The script writes both `dist/firmware/opencode-buddy-sticks3-v{version}-full.bin`
for USB flashing at `0x0` and `*-app.bin` for OTA.

| **Face-down**           | nap (energy refills) |             |             |             |

The screen auto-powers off after 30 seconds of inactivity and stays on while an approval is pending.

## GIF Characters

If you want a custom GIF character instead of the ASCII buddy, push a character pack folder over the buddy transfer path. The bridge streams it over BLE and the stick switches to GIF mode live. `Settings -> delete char` returns to ASCII mode.

Character packs need a `manifest.json` plus 96px-wide GIFs. See `characters/bufo/` for a working example.
